Reason use docker
-> different software version

Container
-> each stack used in one place

Container vs VM
-> VM
    -> physical hardware
    -> problem
        -> need full OS
        -> slow start
        -> resource intensive
-> containers
    -> lightweight
    -> can start quickly


Docker architecture
-> server => docker engine

Install Docker
-> Link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
-> check version : docker version


Development Workflow
-> add dockerfile


Docker in action
-> start with OS
-> install node
-> copy app files
-> run node app.js

list dockerfile
-> FROM
    -> what want to use
    -> FROM node:alpine
-> COPY . /app
-> CMD node /app/app.js
    -> what command to run
    -> if want to not include /app
        -> add WORKDIR
            -> WORKDIR /app
            -> CMD node app.js

to build docker
-> docker build -t tag-name directory-file
    -> docker build -t hello-docker hello-docker

to check docker image
-> docker image
-> docker image ls

run image
-> docker run docker-name
    -> if image doesn't found local, it will find online

run image in background
-> docker run -d docker-name


to pull docker
-> docker pull docker-name
    -> can check in https://hub.docker.com/
-> docker pull docker-name:latest
    -> docker pull latest

to check current docker running
-> docker ps


to check docker logs image
-> docker logs docker-port
    -> docker port in here can find using docker images

port binding
-> need to binding host port to docker port
-> docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx
    -> -p => port mapping nginx
        -> -p {HOST_PORT}:{CONTAINER_PORT}

stop running docker
-> docker stop docker-port
    -> docker port in here can find using docker images


choosing host port
