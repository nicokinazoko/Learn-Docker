why docker compose
-> to simplified the process and configure services
-> when there is update, no need to run one by one


docker-compose
-> single yaml file
-> using single command to create and start all service application
-> it can be versioned
-> no need to create network


command for docker compose (indentation sensitive)
1. version:'3.1'
    -> version of docker compose
2. services:
    -> list of service in containers that want to run
        -> image
            -> name of image / service that want to use
        -> ports
            -> port used by image / service
        -> environment
            -> like username, password of current service
    -> it can be more than 1 and use same format

execute docker compose
-> docker compose -f file-name.yaml up
    -> -f mean using filename
-> docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
    -> command -d
        -> to run in background

control start up order
-> use depends_on
    -> depends_on:
      - mongo

remove containers
-> docker compose -f compose.yaml down
    -> to remove created by up

stop containers
-> docker compose -f compose.yaml stop

start docker again
-> docker compose -f compose.yaml start
